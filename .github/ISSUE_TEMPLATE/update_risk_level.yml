      description: Explain why you believe the risk level should be updated
      placeholder: |
        The current risk level is "Safe" but removal causes issues with:
        - Feature X no longer works
        - App Y crashes frequently
        - System becomes unstable after reboot
        
        Therefore, it should be "Caution" or "Dangerous".
